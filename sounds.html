	<h1>The Sounds of the Planet</h1>
	<p>This futurist planet has cities that contribute to the success of the planet. The buildings are clad in the native planets, <br> the animals live in harmony amongst the people. The technology is advanced. As with any good city the solitude of nature is only miles away; and the people <br> value both equally. Birds and bugs create a background noise that is calming and serene. The weather patterns omit a frequent soft hum. When not on <br> the planet Jadzia travels with a modest crew where the design of their spaceship is modeled after their home. The center of the ship is their enviromental <br> deck, a complete replica of the gorgeous and giving forest. Back on their world the planet glows in the bask of two suns, the days are long and and warm. <br> The ancient memebers of their society valued living in harmony with the land while still advancing their technology; the people pay homage to nature once<br>a year in a great festival.</p>
